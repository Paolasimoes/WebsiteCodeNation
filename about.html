                <h2>Hola!</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Paola and I am a female Design Engineer from Venezuela.
                    I graduated in 2021 from Manchester Metropolitan University.
                    In my career I study, research and design different products using 
                    Computer-Aided Design Packages to create, test and improve products. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite my career I also enjoy working in creative projects 
                    which is why I opened an e-commerce called Creating with Pao, 
                    worked as a Language Assistant at Museum of Half Truths and also 
                    took part in a Creative Digital Incubator Placement done by SharpFutures.

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                I moved to England from Venezuela when I was 17. When I was 18 I had a road accident where I almost lost my foot. 
                At the time, I just wanted to go back home, but due the security, economical and political issues in Venezuela 
                I was not able to, which meant that I had to get back in my feet as quick as I could, go back to work and crack 
                on with my studies.  
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Thanks to all my hard-work and the support I had from friends, 
                teachers and family (from the distance). I managed to continue my studies, 
                where I exceeded all expectations. College rewarded me with a few awards over 
                the years, as well as supporting me in my career change, 
                from Business Level 1 to Engineering Level 3. 
            </p> 
            <br />
            <p>
                While doing Engineering was something I loved and really enjoyed, 
                I wanted to combine my passion for maths and creative side in my 
                future career, which is why I chose my degree in Design Engineering.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                In my time at University I was nominated by all my lecturers to the Santander Universities 
                Women in Engineer Programme, who asked for outstanding female engineer students, 
                even though I didn't win the programme, I met wonderful and inspiring female engineers, 
                as well as winning a place in the Women's Engineering Society.

            <p>
                During my 2nd year at University, my team and I joined a Snow Sculpture Design Competition 
                where the winner would go to China and represent university in the International Snow Sculpture Competition 
                done at Harbin University. My design proposal won, which meant that my team and I went to china and 
                represented university in the competition.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                This year I was able to complete all my studies and I was awarded my BSc Design Engineer Diploma where I achieved a First Class Honours. 
                I also participated in other activities such a Level 1 British Sign Language course, 
                I was chosen as a Language Assistant at The Museum of Half Truths, 
                completed a placement in a Creative Digital Incubator Placement done by SharpFutures and 
                I am currently taking part in an Unity Professional Artist Bootcamp.

                As you can see, my life have been a little eventful, however, I am sure that there is more to come in the future.
